**Note**: We are actively maintaining/updating our artifacts. Please make sure you are using the latest version.

## Provided Data and Resources

- **Data preparation script**: Located in the `process_data` folder. It generates training data with ground truth symbol information. The script is push-button, and usage instructions are provided in the folder.
- **Binary files and decompiled code**: Available on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/13923982) (`ReSym_rawdata`). This includes raw binary files and corresponding decompiled code we used in this project:
     - `bin/`: Contains raw **non-stripped binary files** with debugging information.
     - `decompiled/`: Decompiled code from **fully stripped** binaries.
     - `metadata.json`: Metadata for the binaries, including project information.
     - **Note**: You can generate annotations using the provided scripts in this repository.
- **Training/inference scripts**: Found in the `training_src` folder for VarDecoder and FieldDecoder models.
- **Training, testing, and prediction data**: Available on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/13923982) (`ReSym_data`). This includes: training data, testing data, and prediction results for FieldDecoder and VarDecoder. 
- **Model checkpoints**: Fine-tuned VarDecoder and FieldDecoder model checkpoints are available on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/13923982).
- **Final results**: Posterior reasoning results for recovering user-defined data structures in folder `posterior_reasoning`. The details and instructions can be found in the folder.
